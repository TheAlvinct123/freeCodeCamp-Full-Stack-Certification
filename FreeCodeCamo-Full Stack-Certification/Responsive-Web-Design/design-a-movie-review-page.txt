        <p>Interstellar is a visually striking and emotionally charged sci-fi epic about humanity’s survival on a dying Earth. As environmental collapse looms, a team of astronauts travels through a mysterious wormhole to find a new planet for humankind. With stunning visuals, Hans Zimmer’s haunting score, and powerful performances—especially from Matthew McConaughey—the film blends high-concept physics with deeply personal themes of love, sacrifice, and time. Its layered narrative may challenge some viewers, but its ambition and heart make it a standout in modern science fiction.</p>
